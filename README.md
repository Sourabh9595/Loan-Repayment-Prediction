# Loan-Repayment-Prediction
 This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan repayment. It uses historical loan and borrower data to classify whether a borrower is likely to repay a loan on time or default. This project demonstrates the use of advanced machine learning workflows for financial risk assessment and decision-making.
